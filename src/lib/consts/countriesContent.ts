        "Moldova, predominantly an Eastern Orthodox country, observes Christian holidays. Different ethnic groups within Moldova adhere to their own customs and culinary traditions. Independence Day on August 27 commemorates Moldova's separation from the Soviet Union. This event is not celebrated in Transdniestria, which retains many Soviet holidays and symbols. Moldovans participate in a calendar marked by planting and harvest fairs with traditional dance, music and folk arts. Notable centers for these cultural activities include the village of Ivancho near Chișinău and the Orheiul Vechi, a restored monastery close to Chișinău. Chișinău stands out as a musical hub, hosting numerous theaters, nightclubs, discotheques and concert halls.",
