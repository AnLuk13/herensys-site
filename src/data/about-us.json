        "question": "Do you help with paying the required in-country contributions?",

        "question": "Is an EOR the same as a professional employer organization (PEO)?",

An EOR becomes the legal employer of your workers, handling all compliance and HR responsibilities in countries where you do not have a legal entity. A PEO, on the other hand, works with your existing entity to co-employ workers and help manage HR tasks, but you remain the legal employer."
